In order to install the below docker dependencies, I had to add the extra repo.
( container-selinux, fuse-overlayfs ,slirp4netns )
I've browsed base repo path on my broswer, found the rpms and got the "extras" repo path from there, so I've updated
the main base repo file with the below + "sudo yum makecache"

[extras]
name=CentOS-$releasever - Extras
baseurl=https://vault.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7
